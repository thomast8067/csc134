This game is supposed to be a bullet hell game where you control the moon orbiting the earth avoiding projectiles.

Important note the game only supports input from a gamepad, if you use a keyboard nothing will happen.

Left stick moves the Earth.
Right stick moves the Moon.

Unfortunately the game is unfinished in it's current state.

It's missing:
    -Proper bullet handling
    -Scoring system
    -Main menu
